# Weird Encoding

You've been actively exchanging email with one of your colleagues and noticed that you can't open his attachments. Unfortunately, he's just went on a vacation and you need these attached files right now.

You've spent some time studying his emails and discovered that your colleague used the buggy email client which instead of using proper MIME *Base64* encoding for the attachments used other variants differing in characters that represent values `62` and `63`.

Furthermore, different versions of this email client used different variations of the encoding!

Given the `encoding` of the email client which was used to send `attachment`,

decode it.

Here is the default Base64 encoding table:

| Value | Char | Value | Char | Value | Char | Value | Char |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 0 | A | 16 | Q | 32 | g | 48 | w |
| 1 | B | 17 | R | 33 | h | 49 | x |
| 2 | C | 18 | S | 34 | i | 50 | y |
| 3 | D | 19 | T | 35 | j | 51 | z |
| 4 | E | 20 | U | 36 | k | 52 | 0 |
| 5 | F | 21 | V | 37 | l | 53 | 1 |
| 6 | G | 22 | W | 38 | m | 54 | 2 |
| 7 | H | 23 | X | 39 | n | 55 | 3 |
| 8 | I | 24 | Y | 40 | o | 56 | 4 |
| 9 | J | 25 | Z | 41 | p | 57 | 5 |
| 10 | K | 26 | a | 42 | q | 58 | 6 |
| 11 | L | 27 | b | 43 | r | 59 | 7 |
| 12 | M | 28 | c | 44 | s | 60 | 8 |
| 13 | N | 29 | d | 45 | t | 61 | 9 |
| 14 | O | 30 | e | 46 | u | 62 | + |
| 15 | P | 31 | f | 47 | v | 63 | / |

## Example

For `encoding = "-_"` and `message = "Q29kZVNpZ25hbA=="`, the output should be

`solution(encoding, message) = "CodeSignal"`.

## Input/Output

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)**

- **[input] string encoding**

	Two distinct characters used for values `62` and `63` instead of `+` and `/`.

	It's guaranteed that these characters are not equal to '=' or used for encoding values from `0` to `61`.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`encoding.length = 2`,

	`encoding[0] ≠ encoding[1]`.

- **[input] string message**

	A message to decode.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`4 ≤ message.length ≤ 1000`.

- **[output] string**

	A decoded message.
