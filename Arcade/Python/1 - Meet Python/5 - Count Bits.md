# Count Bits

Implement a function that, given an integer `n`, uses a specific method on it and returns the number of bits in its binary representation.

*Note: in this task and most of the following tasks you will be given a code snippet with some part of it replaced by the ellipsis (`...`). Only this part is allowed to be changed*.

## Example

For `n = 50`, the output should be

`solution(n) = 6`.

<code>50<sub>10</sub> = 110010<sub>2</sub></code>, a number that consists of `6` digits. Thus, the output should be `6`.

## Input/Output

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py)**

- **[input] integer n**

	A positive integer.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	<code>1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>9</sup></code>.

- **[output] integer**

	The number of bits in binary representation of `n`.
