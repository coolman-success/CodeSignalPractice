# Simple Composition

In computer science, function composition is a mechanism of combining simple functions to build more complicated ones. Here's the deal: your colleague working on the databases implemented a low-level API that you have to deal with, and there's no way for you to update it and make it more sophisticated (or simply useful). Now you need to make a function that will be able to combine low-level functions into a single one using the function composition.

Given two functions `f` and `g` that you need to combine and a variable `x`, return the result of the applying the function to `x`, i.e. `f(g(x))`.

## Example

For `f = "math.log10"`, `g = "abs"`, and `x = -100`,

the output should be

`solution(f, g, x) = 2`.

`math.log10(abs(x)) = log10(abs(-100)) = log10(100) = 2`.

## Input/Output

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)**

- **[input] string f**

	A function given as a string. It is guaranteed that the result of applying function `eval` to `f` produces a valid function. It is also guaranteed that `eval(f)` is defined in point `x`.

- **[input] string g**

	A function in the same format as `f`.

- **[input] float x**

	The argument of the functions. It is guaranteed to have at most `1` digit after the decimal point.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`-1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000`.

- **[output] float**

	The result of applying composition of functions `f` and `g` to `x`. Your output will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code>.
