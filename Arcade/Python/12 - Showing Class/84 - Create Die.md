# Create Die

Don Corletwo, local Mafia boss, asked you for a favor, and you, naturally, cannot say no. An yahtzee championship will be held soon enough, and Don needs to make sure that his player has a decent chance to win. You are assigned with the task of writing the dice interface for the game. As a Python programmer, you can use the `random` module to generate random numbers that will determine the result of throwing an `n`-sides die.

Of course, `random` module can get predictable results if given a proper `seed` value. Your task is to implement a function that, given the `seed` for `random` module and the number of sides on the die `n`, will return the value on the die using the following formula: `int(random.random() * n) + 1`.

## Example

For `seed = 37237` and `n = 5`, the output should be

`solution(seed, n) = 3`.

## Input/Output

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)**

- **[input] integer seed**

	The seed for `random` module.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`2 ≤ seed ≤ 50000`.

- **[input] integer n**

	The number of sides on a die.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`2 ≤ n ≤ 12`.

- **[output] integer**

	The number obtained by rolling the die generated as described above.
