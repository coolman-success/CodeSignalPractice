# To Human Age

After years of practicing psychology you decided that it's time to find the answer to the following very important question: how can different species live together in harmony? In order to answer this question, you headed out for a long journey. After several years of wandering, you finally found what you were looking for: a village where humans, cats and dogs lived in the perfect harmony.

Trying to understand the source of this harmony, you are gathering information about all `members` of the village community. You're currently working on determining the age of each member converted to human age. Here's how cats and dogs age can be converted:

- The first and the second years of a cat's life are roughly equal to `12.5` years of a human's, and after this, each additional year is around four 'human years'.
- The first year of a dog's life is equal to `15` years of a human's life, the second dog's year is equal to another `9` years of a human's life, and after this, each additional year is around four 'human years'.

Given information about the `members` of the village community, return information about their ages converted to human age.

## Example

For `members = [["cat", "2"], ["dog", "2"], ["human", "2"]]`,

the output should be

```
solution(members) = ["25 y.o. in human age", 
                       "24 y.o. in human age", 
                       "2 y.o. in human age"]
```

## Input/Output

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)**

- **[input] array.array.string members**

	A list representing the members of the village community. Each member is given in the format <code>[<i>type</i>, <i>age</i>]</code>, where `type` can be `"cat"`, `"dog"` or `"human"`, and `age` is an integer in range `[0, 20]`.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`1 ≤ members.length ≤ 50`,

	`members[i].length = 2`,

	`members[i][0] ∈ {"cat", "dog", "human"}`,

	`0 ≤ int(members[i][1]) ≤ 20`.

- **[output] array.string**

	Information about each member (in the same order as they go in `members`) in the format <code><i>&lt;age&gt;</i> y.o. in human age</code>.
