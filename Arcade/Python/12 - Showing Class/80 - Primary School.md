# Primary School

Tomorrow is Jim's first day as a teacher in a primary school. He's quite nervous about his new job, and in order to relax he decides to write a simple program, because nothing calms as much as coding.

Since Jim is going to tell the kids about rectangles, he wants to implement a function that will calculate the area of rectangle of the given `height` and `width` and show how the result is obtained. Help Jim to gain his confidence and implement the function he needs.

## Example

For `height = 7` and `width = 4`, the output should be

`solution(height, width) = "7 x 4 = 28"`.

The area of the rectangle of size `7 × 4` is calculated as `7 * 4` and is equal to `28`.

## Input/Output

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)**

- **[input] integer height**

	The height of the rectangle.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`1 ≤ height ≤ 20`.

- **[input] integer width**

	The width of the rectangle.

	*Guaranteed constraints:*

	`1 ≤ width ≤ 20`.

- **[output] string**

	A string containing the area of the given rectangle and how it was obtained in the format <code><i>"height x width = area"</i></code>.
