## About CodeSignal

##### [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeSignal)

[CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com) is a technical interview and assessment platform operated by American company BrainFights, Inc.

CodeSignal, initially called CodeFights, was founded in 2014. CodeFights provided a platform for developers to compete in head-to-head timed coding challenges. In 2017, CodeFights began to offer an interview practice mode, as well as a product for recruiters to connect with qualified technical candidates.

In 2018, the company changed the name of its platform from CodeFights to CodeSignal, and introduced a Coding Score that developers could share with technical recruiters, based on challenges completed on CodeSignal.[8] Since then, the CodeSignal platform has expanded to offer a suite of technical interview and assessment products.
